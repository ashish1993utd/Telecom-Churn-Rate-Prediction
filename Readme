This data set provides info to help you predict behavior to retain customers. One can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs. A telecommunications company is concerned about the number of customers leaving their landline business for cable competitors. They need to understand who is leaving. 

We need to  to find out who is leaving and why?

The data set includes information about:

•	Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
•	Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
•	Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
•	Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

I have analyzed the data to answer following question:

1.	Use SAS to develop a good logistic regression model to predict which customers are likely to leave (churn)?
2.	Include a table of coefficients, t-values, and odds ratio. Interpret the logistic output explaining AIC/BIC, meaning of coefficients, significance, prediction accuracy (percent concordance), odds-ratios etc.
3.	Which are the top three factors that affect churn in your model.
4.	What other variables (that if collected) would help to improve the fit of the model.
5.	Compute the hit ratio for your model. Hit ratio is defined as the percentage of correct predictions using the logit model. Use the model to predict 1 or 0 using the same data.
